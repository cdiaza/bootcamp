#Ex: give the value 3 to a, 5 to b and 0 to c
a, b, c = 3, 5, 0


#Ex: divide a by b and b by a
a/b
b/a

#Ex: same, with integer division
a//b
b//a

#Ex: divide a by c, with float and integer division
#a/c
#a//c

#Ex: calculate b modulo a and b modulo c
b%a
#b%c

#Ex: calculate b to the power a
b**a

#Ex: set a,b,c,d to 1,2,4,12 and find 1 or 2 ways to combine all 4 variables with +-*// to make 24
#example: a*(c-b)*d
a,b,c,d = 1,2,4,12
a*(c-b)*d
(d-c)*(a+b)
(a+b)*c+d
a*c*d//b

#Ex: set a to 7
a = 7

#Ex: add 10 to a

#Ex: check the type of a
type(a)

#Ex: without touching the "7" key on your keyboard, set b to the float value of 7
b = 1.0 * a

#Ex: check that b is a float
type(b)

#Ex: guess what the type of a+b should be
type(a+b)

#Ex: which strings can be cast to False? Which strings are cast to True?
bool("")
bool("anything else")

#Ex: ehich string can be cast to int?
int("12")


#Ex: what is the largest int you can define?
#Ans: something big enough to use all your computer's memory

#Ex: set c to "hello goodbye" using a and b
a = "hello"
b = "goodbye"
c = a + " " + b

#Ex: set a to "I like Skill Pills! " repeated 100 times
a = 100*"I like Skill Pills! "

#Ex: set b to True using only a
a = False
b = not a
